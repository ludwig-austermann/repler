repler
======
an automatic in file replacer

This project was made for the purpose to automatically edit files after editing.
For instance, you may do a programming tutorial and frequently copy the code of it, but you want your own features to remain, just specify the parts to be replaced in a json file and run the commands.

Usage and Syntax
----------------
At first you have to create your json file, if you dont know how, take a look at patterns.json. Then run:

```
repler.exe <TARGET FILE> <PATTERN FILE>
```

(probably) coming features
--------------------------
- multiple target files
- commands to execute afterwards
- create example json file

Contribution
------------
Contribution is always welcome.
